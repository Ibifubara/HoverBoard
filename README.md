# HoverBoard - A code along from Brad Traversy's youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtunPQtr-Xw

## Overview
- The task was to build a container of mini boxes
- Display random colors when the mouse hovers on any of the boxes
- Allow the colors to fade away when the mouse is out of the box
- Add nice transitions to make the processs smooth
  
## Future Study:
- I hope to keep learning and improving on previous knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Learn about methods, events in Javascript also
